## Lessons Learned

When building Exodus, the thesis behind this project was to present as much actionable data to the end user to make sound and educated decisions.

The lessons I've learned are as follows:

- Planning is just as important as development (at least if you want a smooth dev experience)
- Always assuming requests will fail and planning what to do when the request fails 
- Using and implementing Chartjs to create live charts
- Implementing Wallet authentication
- Using Ether.js and Alchemy node to connect to the blockchain
- Using Wagmi & ConnectKit for wallet connection
